The painting is not signed, but described and mentioned by the artist in his letters on various occasions.
               </p><p id="p19" class="calibre29">Visitors of the site can still stand at the northeastern corner of the Place du Forum, where the artist set up his easel. He looked south towards the artificially lit terrace of the popular coffee house, as well as into the enforced darkness of the rue du Palais leading up to the building structure (to the left, not pictured) and, beyond this structure, the tower of a former church (now Musée Lapidaire). Towards the right, Van Gogh indicated a lighted shop as well, and some branches of the trees surrounding the place—but he omitted the remainders of the Roman monuments just beside this little shop.</p><p id="p23" class="calibre29">The painting is currently at the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, Netherlands.</p></div><p class="calibre29">        </p><h2 id="h22" class="calibre28">The Artist</h2><div class="layout-rw1" id="col-28"><p id="p31" class="calibre29"><strong class="calibre30">Vincent Willem van Gogh</strong> (Dutch: 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch post-Impressionist painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art.
               </p><p id="p28" class="calibre29">After years of painful anxiety and frequent bouts of mental illness, he died aged 37 from a gunshot wound, generally accepted to be self-inflicted. His work was then known to only a handful of people and appreciated by fewer still.</p><p id="p32" class="calibre29">He did not begin painting until his late twenties, completing many of his best-known works during the last two years of his life. His work included self portraits, landscapes, still lifes, portraits and paintings of cypresses, wheat fields and sunflowers.</p><p id="p34" class="calibre29">The extent to which his mental health affected his painting has been a subject of speculation since his death. Despite a widespread tendency to romanticize his ill health, modern critics see an artist deeply frustrated by the inactivity and incoherence brought about by his bouts of illness.</p></div><p class="calibre29">     </p><p class="calibre29">   </p><p class="calibre29">   </p></div></section>
