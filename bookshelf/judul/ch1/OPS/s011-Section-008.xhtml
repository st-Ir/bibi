               </p><p id="p58" class="calibre29">Van Gogh's own title for this composition was simply The Bedroom (French: La Chambre à coucher). There are three authentic versions described in his letters, easily discernible from one another by the pictures on the wall to the right.</p><p id="p59" class="calibre29">The painting depicts Van Gogh's bedroom at 2, Place Lamartine in Arles, Bouches-du-Rhône, France, known as his Yellow House. The door to the right was opening to the upper floor and the staircase, the door to the left served the guest room he held prepared for Gauguin. The window in the front wall was looking to Place Lamartine and its public gardens. This room was not rectangular, but trapezoid. Van Gogh evidently did not spend much time on this problem, he simply indicated that there was a corner, somehow.</p></div><p id="p61" class="calibre29">       </p><h2 id="h212" class="calibre28">The Artist</h2><div class="layout-rw1"><p id="p6" class="calibre29"><strong class="calibre30">Vincent Willem van Gogh</strong> (Dutch: 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch post-Impressionist painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art.
               </p><p id="p62" class="calibre29">After years of painful anxiety and frequent bouts of mental illness, he died aged 37 from a gunshot wound, generally accepted to be self-inflicted. His work was then known to only a handful of people and appreciated by fewer still.</p><p id="p17" class="calibre29">He did not begin painting until his late twenties, completing many of his best-known works during the last two years of his life. His work included self portraits, landscapes, still lifes, portraits and paintings of cypresses, wheat fields and sunflowers.</p><p id="p18" class="calibre29">In March 1886, he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists. Later, he moved to the south of France and was influenced by the strong sunlight he found there. His work grew brighter in color, and he developed the unique and highly recognizable style that became fully realized during his stay in Arles in 1888.</p></div><p class="calibre29">     </p><p class="calibre29">   </p><p class="calibre29">   </p></div></section>
