The painting is 56.81 by 63.94 inches (144.3 cm × 162.4 cm), displayed in a frame of Whistler's own design in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, having been bought by the French state in 1891.</p><p id="p39" class="calibre29">It is now one of the most famous works by an American artist outside the United States. It has been variously described as an American icon and a Victorian Mona Lisa.</p><p id="p40" class="calibre29">The sensibilities of a Victorian era viewing audience would not accept what was apparently a portrait being exhibited as a mere "arrangement"; thus the explanatory title "Portrait of the Artist's Mother" was appended. It was from this that the work acquired its popular name. After Thomas Carlyle viewed the painting, he agreed to sit for a similar composition, this one being titled Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 2. Thus the previous painting became Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 1 more or less by default.</p></div>

Averse to sentimentality and moral allusion in painting, he was a leading proponent of the credo, "art for art's sake". Finding a parallel between painting and music, Whistler entitled many of his paintings "arrangements", "harmonies", and "nocturnes", emphasizing the primacy of tonal harmony.
               </p><p id="p44" class="calibre29">Whistler influenced the art world and the broader culture of his time with his artistic theories and his friendships with leading artists and writers.</p><p id="p45" class="calibre29">During his life, he affected two generations of artists, in Europe and in the United States. Whistler had significant contact and exchanged ideas and ideals with Realist, Impressionist, and Symbolist painters. As American critic Charles Caffin wrote in 1907:</p><p id="p46" class="calibre29">    "He did better than attract a few followers and imitators; he influenced the whole world of art. Consciously, or unconsciously, his presence is felt in countless studios; his genius permeates modern artistic thought."</p></div><p class="calibre29">    </p><p class="calibre29">   </p><p class="calibre29"> </p></div></section>
